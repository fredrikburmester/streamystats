# Streamystats

Streamystats is a statistics service for Jellyfin, providing analytics and data visualization. üìà Built with modern advanced frameworks.

> This is a hobby project of mine. Don't expect fast development.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking change

Streamystats V2 is a complete rewrite of the backend of this application. It's not backwards compatible with V1. If you're using V1, please read the migration guide below.

### Migrating from V1 to V2

**Before upgrading:**
1. **Backup database**: `docker exec -t streamystats_db pg_dumpall -c -U postgres > backup.sql`
2. **Export your data** from V1 settings page (downloads as `.db` file)
3. **Convert to JSON**: `sqlite3 input.db -json "SELECT * FROM playback_sessions;" > exported_data.json`
4. **Remove old containers**: `docker compose down -v`
5. **Get new docker-compose.yml** and start fresh V2 installation
6. **Import data** via V2 Settings ‚Üí Legacy Import

**Note**: There's a new docker compose file and new Docker images. Please read carefully.

## ‚ú® Features

- üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard with overview statistics, live sessions and more!
- üë§ User-specific watch history and statistics
- üåü Most popular item tracking
- üìö Library statistics
- ‚è±Ô∏è Watch time graphs with advanced filtering
- üè† Multi-server and user support
- üîÑ Full sync options of items, libraries and users from the settings page
- üßπ Supported by Janitorr (beta)
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Import data from Jellystat and Playback Reporting Plugin to get started!

## Roadmap

- [ ] Only sync certain libraries
- [ ] Individual item statistics
- [ ] More statistics about unwatched items and maybe the possibility to remove old or unwatched items
- [ ] More granular sync options

## üöÄ Getting started

> Playback reporting plugin is no longer needed and Streamystats soely relies on the Jellyfin API for statistics.

### Docker

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose if you haven't already.
2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to your desired location. Use tag `:edge` (read more below in [Version Tags](#version-tags).
3. Change any ports if needed. Default web port is `3000`.
4. Change the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` in the `docker-compose.yml` file to a random string. You can generate one with `openssl rand -hex 64`.
5. Start the application with `docker-compose up -d`
6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
7. Follow the setup wizard to connect your Jellyfin server.

First time load can take a while, depending on the size of your library.

### Version Tags

Version tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`) are automatically generated on release. These tags provide stable, tested reference points for production use. I recommend pinning to specific version tags for stability.

The `:edge` tag always points to the latest commit on the main branch. It contains the most recent features and fixes. While typically stable, it may occasionally contain breaking changes

### Dockerless

Docker is currently the easiest and recommended way to run streamystats. However you can also run without docker.

[See the documentation](DOCKERLESS.md)

## Timezone Configuration

StreamyStats now supports proper timezone configuration to ensure that timestamps are displayed correctly for your local timezone.

### Setting Your Timezone

To configure your timezone, set the `TZ` environment variable in your docker-compose environment. For example:

**For European Central Time (CET/CEST):**
```bash
export TZ=Europe/Berlin
docker-compose up -d
```

**For US Eastern Time:**
```bash
export TZ=America/New_York
docker-compose up -d
```

**For other timezones:**
```bash
export TZ=Asia/Tokyo  # For Japan Standard Time
export TZ=Australia/Sydney  # For Australian Eastern Time
export TZ=UTC  # For UTC (default)
docker-compose up -d
```

### How It Works

- All containers (nextjs-app, job-server, migrate, vectorchord) now respect the `TZ` environment variable
- Timestamps from Jellyfin are stored with proper timezone information in the database
- When displaying timestamps to users, they are converted to your configured timezone
- If no `TZ` is set, the system defaults to UTC

### Troubleshooting Timezone Issues

If you're seeing timestamps that are off by a few hours:

1. **Check your current timezone setting:**
   ```bash
   echo $TZ
   ```

2. **Set the correct timezone and restart containers:**
   ```bash
   export TZ=Europe/Berlin  # Replace with your timezone
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify the timezone is applied:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec nextjs-app date
   ```

The timezone changes will take effect immediately for new data. Existing timestamp displays will also be corrected without needing to re-sync data from Jellyfin.
